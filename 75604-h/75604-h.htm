goodly uplands, and thy down lands? all sunk into
that little pit, lechery. Why should a gallant pay

uncle’s conscience, which is three years’ voyage
about: he that sets out upon his conscience ne’er
finds the way home again; he is either swallowed
in the quicksands of law-quillets, or splits upon the
piles of a <span lang="la"><i>præmunire</i></span>; yet these old fox-brained

her virtues. Well, how should a man live now
that has no living? hum,—why, are there not a

their brain, and make their wits their mercers;

both desperate, they are soon resolute: but how
for horses?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Wit.</span> Mass, that’s true; the jest will be of some
continuance. Let me see; horses now, a bots on
’em! Stay, I have acquaintance with a mad host,
never yet bawd to thee; I have rinsed the whoreson’s
gums in mull-sack many a time and often:
put but a good tale into his ear now, so it come

to catch that old fox mine uncle: though he make
but some amends for my undoing, yet there’s some
comfort in’t, he cannot otherwise choose (though it
be but in hope to cozen me again) but supply any
hasty want that I bring to town with me. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>device well and cunningly carried, the name of a
rich widow, and four hundred a-year in good earth,
will so conjure up a kind of usurer’s love in him
to me, that he will not only desire my presence,—which
at first shall scarce be granted him, I’ll keep
off a’ purpose,—but I shall find him so officious to
deserve, so ready to supply! I know the state of
an old man’s affection so well: if his nephew be
poor indeed, why, he lets God alone with him;
but if he be once rich, then he’ll be the first man
that helps him.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Cour.</span> ’Tis right the world; for, in these days,
an old man’s love to his kindred is like his kindness
to his wife, ’tis always done before he comes
at it.</p>

all my wealth; prepare thyself, away. I’ll to mine

into his ear, which shall have the gift to
turn all the wax to honey. [<i>Exit Courtesan.</i>]—How

and cozened him himself.</p>

I know no reason but the match might go forward

there be a dissension between the two old men, I
see no reason it should put a difference between
the two younger; ’tis as natural for old folks to
fall out, as for young to fall in. A scholar comes
a-wooing to my niece; well, he’s wise, but he’s
poor: her son comes a-wooing to my niece; well,

draw some goodness from the usuring rascal; for
I have put her in hope already of some estate that
I have either in land or money: now, if I be found

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Ah, what is he, I prithee?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> A country gentleman too; one whom
your worship knows not, I’m sure; has spent
some few follies in his youth, but marriage, by my
faith, begins to call him home: my mistress loves
him, sir, and love covers faults, you know: one
master Witgood, if ever you have heard of the
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Ha! Witgood, sayst thou?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> That’s his name indeed, sir; my mistress
is like to bring him to a goodly seat yonder; four
hundred a-year, by my faith.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> But, I pray, take me with you.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Ay, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> What countryman might this young Witgood
be?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> A Leicestershire gentleman, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> My nephew, by th’ mass, my nephew! I’ll
fetch out more of this, i’faith: a simple country
fellow, I’ll work’t out of him. [<i>Aside.</i>]—And is that
gentleman, sayst thou, presently to marry her?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Faith, he brought her up to town, sir;
has the best card in all the bunch for’t, her heart;
and I know my mistress will be married ere she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>go down; nay, I’ll swear that, for she’s none of
those widows that will go down first, and be married
after; she hates that, I can tell you, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> By my faith, sir, she is like to have a
proper gentleman, and a comely; I’ll give her
that gift.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Why, does your worship know him, sir?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> I know him? does not all the world know
him? can a man of such exquisite qualities be hid
under a bushel?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Then your worship may save me a labour,
for I had charge given me to inquire after
him.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Inquire of him? If I might counsel thee,
thou shouldst ne’er trouble thyself further; inquire
of him of no more but of me; I’ll fit thee.
I grant he has been youthful; but is he not now
reclaimed? mark you that, sir: has not your mistress,
think you, been wanton in her youth? if
men be wags, are there not women wagtails?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> No doubt, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Does not he return wisest that comes home
whipt with his own follies?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Why, very true, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> The worst report you can hear of him, I
can tell you, is that he has been a kind gentleman,
a liberal, and a worthy: who but lusty Witgood,
thrice-noble Witgood!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Since your worship has so much knowledge
in him, can you resolve<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a> me, sir, what his
living might be? my duty binds me, sir, to have
a care of my mistress’ estate; she has been ever
a good mistress to me, though I say it: many
wealthy suitors has she nonsuited for his sake;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>yet though her love be so fixed, a man cannot tell
whether his non-performance may help to remove
it, sir: he makes us believe he has lands and
living.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Who, young master Witgood? why, believe
it, he has as goodly a fine living out yonder,—what
do you call the place?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Nay, I know not, i’faith.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Hum—see, like a beast, if I have not
forgot the name—pooh! and out yonder again,
goodly grown woods and fair meadows: pax<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a> on’t,
I can ne’er hit of that place neither: he? why,
he’s Witgood of Witgood Hall; he, an unknown
thing!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Is he so, sir? To see how rumour will
alter! trust me, sir, we heard once he had no
lands, but all lay mortgaged to an uncle he has
in town here.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Push,<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> ’tis a tale, ’tis a tale.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> I can assure you, sir, ’twas credibly reported
to my mistress.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Why, do you think, i’faith, he was ever so
simple to mortgage his lands to his uncle? or his
uncle so unnatural to take the extremity of such a
mortgage?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> That was my saying still, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Pooh, ne’er think it.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Yet that report goes current.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Nay, then you urge me:
Cannot I tell that best that am his uncle?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> How, sir? what have I done!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Why, how now! in a swoon, man?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Is your worship his uncle, sir?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Can that be any harm to you, sir?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> I do beseech you, sir, do me the favour
to conceal it: what a beast was I to utter so
much! pray, sir, do me the kindness to keep it
in; I shall have my coat pulled o’er my ears, an’t
should be known; for the truth is, an’t please
your worship, to prevent much rumour and many
suitors, they intend to be married very suddenly
and privately.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> And dost thou think it stands with my
judgment to do them injury? must I needs say the
knowledge of this marriage comes from thee? am
I a fool at fifty-four? do I lack subtlety now, that
have got all my wealth by it? There’s a leash of
angels<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a> for thee: come, let me woo thee speak
where lie they?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> So I might have no anger, sir——</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Passion of me, not a jot: prithee, come.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> I would not have it known, sir,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> it came
by my means.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> Why, am I a man of wisdom?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> I dare trust your worship, sir; but I’m
a stranger to your house; and to avoid all intelligencers,
I desire your worship’s ear.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> This fellow’s worth a matter of trust.
[<i>Aside.</i>]—Come, sir. [<i>Host whispers to him.</i>] Why,
now thou’rt an honest lad.—Ah, sirrah, nephew!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Host.</span> Please you, sir, now I have begun with

upon that doubtful point? I must come warily
now.</p>

To-morrow’s evening shall resolve the doubt.</p>

me a stranger for? Hum,—I hope he has not so
much wit to apprehend that I cozened him: he

thought it would ever have come to this pass! yet
he’s a proper gentleman, i’faith, give him his due,
marry, that’s his mortgage; but that I ne’er mean
to give him: I’ll make him rich enough in words,
if that be good; and if it come to a piece of money,
I will not greatly stick for’t; there may be hope
some of the widow’s lands, too, may one day fall
upon me, if things be carried wisely.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> He knows it already, and the knave’s

him here i’ th’ city, great merchants’ wives; and
do you think he would once look upon ’em? forsooth,
he’ll none: you are beholding<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a> to him i’ th’

and happy were they that could catch him first.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Court.</span> I think so.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Luc.</span> O, there would be such running to and

he’d be took up in one great house or other presently:
faugh! they know he has it, and must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>have it. You see this house here, widow; this
house and all comes to him; goodly rooms, ready
furnished, ceiled with plaster of Paris, and all
hung about<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a> with cloth of arras.—Nephew.</p>

an ass? would I were in thy stead! get you up,
I am ashamed of you. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class='sc'>Witgood</span> <i>and Courtesan</i>].
So: let ’em agree as they will now: many
a match has been struck up in my house a’ this

nothing like an uncle’s house to strike the stroke
in. I’ll hold my wife in talk a little.—Now, Jenny,
your son there goes a-wooing to a poor gentlewoman

<p class='c031'><i>At London Printed for John Helmes, and are to be sold in Saint
Dunstans Churchyard in Fleetstreet.</i> 1608. 4to.</p>

<p class='c032'>Though there is undoubtedly but one edition of this drama,
yet the copies differ slightly in several places; alterations
having been introduced after part of the impression had been
worked off: a circumstance which will surprise those persons
only who have not been accustomed to collate the 4tos of old
English plays.</p>

<p class='c031'><cite>The Family of Love</cite> was licensed by Sir George Bucke,
12th Oct. 1607: see Chalmers’s <cite>Suppl. Apol.</cite> p. 201.</p>

<p class='c031'>Concerning the sect which gives the title to the play, the
following notices will be perhaps more than sufficient.</p>

<p class='c031'>In Brandt’s <cite>Hist. of the Reform. &#38;c. in the Low Countries</cite>, we
are told, under the year 1555: “That Family was suspected
of being more addicted to carnal than to spiritual love. Henry
Nicholas, a Westphalian, born at Munster, but who had lived
a great while at Amsterdam, and some time likewise at Embden,
was father of this Family. He appeared upon the stage
about the year 1540, stiled himself the <em>deified man</em>, boasted of
great matters, and seemed to exalt himself above the condition
of a human creature. He was, as he pretended, greater
than Moses and Christ, because Moses had taught mankind
to <em>hope</em>, Christ to <em>believe</em>, but he to <em>love</em>; which last being of
more worth than both the former, he was consequently greater
than both those prophets.” vol. i. p. 105, ed. 1720.</p>

<p class='c031'>According to some writers, however, the sect was not
founded by Henry Nicholas, but by David George, an anabaptist
of Delft; and indeed there seems reason to believe
that the Family of Love grew out of the heresies of George,
with whom Nicholas had been on intimate terms.</p>

<p class='c031'>“As to his [Nicholas’s] pretensions,” observes Mosheim,
“they were indeed visionary and chimerical; for he maintained
that he had a commission from heaven to teach men
that the essence of religion consisted in the feelings of <em>divine
love</em>; that all other theological tenets, whether they related to
objects of faith or modes of worship, were of no sort of moment;
and consequently that it was a matter of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>perfect indifference what opinions Christians entertained concerning
the divine nature, provided their hearts burned with
the pure and sacred flame of piety and love. To this, his
main doctrine, Nicholas may have probably added other odd
fancies, as always is the case with those innovators who are
endued with a warm and fruitful imagination: to come, however,
at a true notion of the opinions of this enthusiast, it
will be much easier to consult his own writings than to depend
entirely upon the accounts and refutations of his adversaries.”
<cite>Eccles. Hist.</cite> (by <span class='sc'>Maclaine</span>), vol. iv. p. 484.</p>

<p class='c031'>“Not content,” says Fuller, “to confine his errours to his
own country, over he [Nicholas] comes into England, and in
the later end of the reign of Edward the Sixth joyned himself
to the Dutch congregation in London, where he seduced a
number of artificers and silly women,” &#38;c. <cite>Church Hist.</cite>
b. ix. p. 112, ed. 1655.</p>

<p class='c031'>“The twelfe of June [1575], stood at Paules Crosse fiue
persons Englishmen, of the sect termed the Familie of Loue,
who there confessed themselues vtterlie to detest as well the
author of that sect H. N. as all his damnable errors and heresies.”
<span class='sc'>Holinshed’s</span> <cite>Chron.</cite> vol. iv. p. 328, ed. 1808.</p>

<p class='c031'>Towards the end of 1580, the sect was increasing so rapidly
in England, that the government took active measures for its
suppression. “The queenes maiestie being informed that in
sundrie places of this realme, certeine persons secretlie taught
damnable heresies, contrarie to diuers principall articles of
our beleefe and christian faith, who to colour their sect named
themselues the Familie of Loue, and then as manie as were
allowed by them to be of that familie to be elect and saued,
and all others, of what church soeuer they be, to be reiected
and damned. And for that vpon conuenting of some of them
before the bishops and ordinaries, it was found that the
ground of their sect is mainteined by certeine lewd, hereticall,
and seditious books, first made in the Dutch toong, and lastlie
translated into English, and printed beyond the seas, and
secretlie brought ouer into the realme, the author whereof
they name H. N. &#38;c. And considering also it is found, that
those sectaries held opinion, that they may before anie magistrat
or ecclesiasticall or temporall, or anie other person,
noi being professed to be of their sect, by oth or otherwise
denie anie thing for their aduantage: so as though manie of
them are well knowne to be teachers and spreaders abroad of
these dangerous and damnable sects; yet by their owne confession
they cannot be condemned. Therefore hir maiestie
being verie sorie to see so great an euill, by malice of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>diuell to be brought into this hir realme, and by hir bishops
and ordinaries she vnderstandeth it verie requisit, not onelie
to haue those dangerous heretiks and sectaries to be seueralie
punished; but that also other meanes be vsed by hir maiesties
roiall authoritie, which is giuen hir of God to defend
Christs church, to root them out from further infecting of hir
realme: she hath thought meet and conuenient, and so by
hir proclamation commandeth, that all hir officers and ministers
temporall shall in all their seuerall vocations assist the
bishops of hir realme, and all other person, to search out all
persons dulie suspected to be either teachers or professors of
the foresaid damnable sects, and by all good meanes to proceed
seuerelie against them, being found culpable, by order
of the lawes ecclesiasticall or temporall: and that all search
be made in all places suspected, for the books and writings
mainteining the said heresies and sects, and them to destroie
and burne, &#38;c: as more at large may appeere by the said
proclamation, giuen at Richmond the third of October, and
proclamed at London on the nineteenth daie of the same
moneth [1580].” <span class='sc'>Holinshed’s</span> <cite>Chron.</cite> vol. iv. p. 432, ed. 1808.
See also <span class='sc'>Camdeni</span> <cite>Annales</cite>, p. 318, ed. 1639.</p>

<p class='c031'>A list of Nicholas’s numerous writings may be found in
Lowndes’s <cite>Bibliographer’s Manual</cite>. One of them is in verse:
<cite>An Enterlude of Myndes: witnessing the Mans Fall from God
and Christ. Set forth by H. N. and by him newly perused and
amended. Translated out of Base-Almayne into English.</cite> n. d.:
see an account of, and extracts from it, in Sir E. Brydges’s
<cite>Restituta</cite>, vol. iv. p. 140, sqq. Nicholas is mentioned in the
last scene of <cite>The Alchemist</cite>,—<span class='sc'>B. Jonson’s</span> <cite>Works</cite>, vol. iv.
p. 187, ed. Giff.</p>

<p class='c031'>“The Family of Love (or Lust rather),” says Fuller, “at
this time [1604] presented a tedious Petition to King James,
so that it is questionable whether his majesty ever graced it
with his perusall, wherein they endeavoured to cleare themselves
from some misrepresentations, and by fawning expression
to insinuate themselves into his majesty’s good opinion.”
<cite>Church Hist.</cite> b. x. p. 29, ed. 1655. Having given the document
in question, which is too long for insertion here, Fuller
proceeds: “I finde not what effect this their Petition produced;
whether it was slighted, and the Petitioners looked
upon as inconsiderable, or beheld as a few frantick folk out
of their wits, which consideration alone often melted their
adversaries anger into pity unto them. The main design
driven on in the Petition is to separate themselves from the
Puritans (as persons odious to King James), that they might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>not fare the worse for their vicinity unto them; though these
Familists could not be so desirous to leave them as the others
were glad to be left by them. For if their opinions were so
senselesse, and the lives of these Familists so sensuall as is
reported, no <em>purity</em> at all belonged unto them.” p. 32. From
the Petition just mentioned, we find that “divers” of the
Familists had been lately thrown into prison.</p>

<p class='c031'>The sect was attacked, at different times, by various writers:
among others by John Rogers, in <cite>The Displaying of an horrible
Secte of grosse &#38; wicked Heretiques, naming themselues the Family
of Loue, with the liues of their Authours, &#38; what doctrine
they teach in corners. Newly set foorth by J. R. &#38;c.</cite> London,

of the left side, for wives always in the
night take the left-side place: but, sir, now come
to the needle on the right side,—that’s the daytime,
wherein she commands; then, sir, she has a
certain thing called tongue, ten times more sharp
than a needle, and that, at the least displeasure, a
man must have shot quite through him.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Shr.</span> Faith, there is, sir, but nothing new.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Lip.</span> Good wag, faith! thou smellest somewhat
of a courtier, though thy mother was a citizen’s
wife.—Off with that filthy great band, nay, quick;
on with your robe of sanctity, nay, suddenly, man.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Gud.</span> And why must we shift ourselves into this
demure habit, if impossible to be of the Family and
keep our own fashion?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Lip.</span> Tut, man, the name of a gallant is more
hateful to them than the sight of a corner-cap.
Hadst thou heard the protestations the wife of a
bellows-mender made but yesternight against gallants,
thou hadst for ever abjured crimson breeches.
She swore that all gallants were persons inferior to
bellows-menders, for the trade of bellows-making
was very aerial and high; and what were men and
women but bellows, for they take wind in at one
place and do evaporate at another;—evaporate was
her very phrase.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Gud.</span> Methinks, her phrase flew with somewhat
too strong a vapour.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Lip.</span> Nay, she proves farther, that all men receive
their being chiefly from bellows, without
which the fire burns not; without fire the pot
seethes not; the pot not seething, powdered beef
is not to be eaten; of which, she then averred our
nation was a great devourer, and without which
they could neither fight for their country abroad,
nor get children at home; for, said she, powdered
beef is a great joiner of nerves together.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Gud.</span> What answer madest thou?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Lip.</span> Marry, that I thought a bawd was a greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>joiner of nerves together than powdered beef: with
that she protested that a bawd was an instrument
of the devil, and as she had proved that bellows-makers
were of God’s trade, so bawds were of the
devil’s trade; for (and thereupon she blew her
nose) the devil and bawds did both live by the
sins of the people.</p>

well in the beating of pulses, and hath been much
conversant in women’s Jordans; but he had ever a
care to raise his patient being before cast down:
his charitable disposition hath been such to poor
folk, that he never took above fourpence for the
casting of a water, which good custom was so well
known among all his patients, that if sixpence were
at any time offered him, they might be bold to ask
and have twopence again. He hath been so skilful
and painful withal in the cure of the green sickness,
that, of my knowledge, he hath risen at all hours in
the night to pleasure maids that have had it: and
for that foul-mouthed disease, termed by a fine
phrase—a pox on’t, what d’ye call’t? O, the grincomes<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c017'><sup>[429]</sup></a>—at

advice is, that you learn the A B C of better manners:
go back and tell how you have been used in
the city; and being thus scoured, keep yourselves
clean, and the bed undefiled.—For you, master

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> Whole suit? ’tis well.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> A poor, kind soul, troubled with a bad
husband; one that puts her to her shifts here.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> He puts her from her shifts, methinks,
when she is fain to pawn her clothes.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> Look you, sir; a fair satin gown, new
taffeta petticoat——</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> Stay, this petticoat has been turned.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> Often turned up and down, and<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c017'><sup>[448]</sup></a> you
will, but never turned, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> Cry you mercy, indeed.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> A fine white beaver, pearl band, three
falls;<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c017'><sup>[449]</sup></a> I ha’ known her have more in her days.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> Alas, and she be but a gentlewoman of any

days! know that: tut, the world’s changed; gentlewomen’s<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c017'><sup>[450]</sup></a>
falls stand upright now; no sin but
has a bolster, that it may lie at ease. Well, what
do you borrow of these, sir?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> Twelve pound, and you will, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> How?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> They were not her’s for twenty.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> Why, so; our pawn is ever thrice the value
of our money, unless in plate and jewels; how
should the months be restored and the use else?
We must cast it for the twelvemonth, so many
pounds, so many months, so many eighteenpences;
then the use of these eighteenpences; then the
want of the return of those pounds: all these must
be laid together; which well considered, the valuation
of the pawn had need to sound treble. Can
six pound pleasure the gentlewoman?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> It may please her, but, like a man of
threescore, in the limberest degree.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> I have but one word more to say in’t;
twenty nobles<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c017'><sup>[451]</sup></a> is all and the utmost that I will
hazard upon’t.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Sec. F.</span> She must be content with’t: the less
borrowed, the better paid; come.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Ar.</span> At hand, sir.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fri.</span> Tell out twenty nobles, and take her name
in a bill.</p>

my house, where should it be done, boy? have I
not a glorious situation?</p>

garden, quaint walks, fantastical arbours, three
back doors, and a coach-gate! nay, thou’rt admirably
seated: little furniture will serve thee;
thou’rt never without moveables.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Pri.</span> Ay, praise my stars! Ah, the goodly virginities
that have been cut up in my house, and
the goodly patrimonies that have lain like sops in
the gravy! and when those sops were eaten, yet
the meat was kept whole for another, and another,
and another; for as in one pie twenty may dip
their sippits, so upon one woman forty may consume
their patrimonies.</p>

<p class='c043'>Courteous reader, let not the title or name of this
comedy be any forestalling or weakening of the
worthy author’s judgment, whose known abilities
will survive to all posterities, though he be long
since dead. I hope the reading thereof shall not
prove distasteful unto any in particular, nor hurtful
unto any in general; but I rather trust that
the language and the plot which you shall find in
each scene shall rather be commended and applauded
than any way derided or scorned. In the
action, which is the life of a comedy, and the glory
of the author, it hath been sufficiently expressed to
the liking of the spectators and commendations of
the actors; who have set it forth in such lively
colours, and to the meaning of the gentleman that
true penned it, that I dare say few can excel them,
though some may equal them. In the reading of
one act you guess the consequence; for here is no
bombasted or fustian stuff, but every line weighed
as with balance, and every sentence placed with
judgment and deliberation. All that you can find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>in the perusal I will give you notice of beforehand,
to prevent a censure that may arise in thy reading
of this comedy, as also for the excuse of the author;
and that is this: here and there you shall find some
lines that do answer in metre; which I hope will
not prove so disdainful, whereby the book may be
so much slighted as not to be read, or the author’s
judgment undervalued as of no worth. Consider,
gentle reader, it is full twenty years<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c017'><sup>[722]</sup></a> since it was
written, at which time metre was most in use, and
shewed well upon the conclusion of every act and
scene. My prevalent hope desires thy charitable
censure, and thereby draws me to be</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Hob.</span> What shall I call thee? the noble spark of
bounty! the life-blood of society!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> Call me your forecast, you whoresons! when
you come drunk out of a tavern, ’tis I must cast
your plots into form still; ’tis I must manage the
prank, or I’ll not give a louse for the proceeding:
I must let fly my civil fortunes, turn wild-brain,
lay my wits upo’ th’ tenters, you rascals, to maintain
a company of villains, whom I love in my very
soul and conscience!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Maw.</span> Aha, our little forecast!</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> Hang you, you have bewitched me among
you! I was as well given<a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c017'><sup>[724]</sup></a> till I fell to be wicked!
my grandsire had hope of me: I went all in black;
swore but a’ Sundays; never came home drunk but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>upon fasting-nights to cleanse my stomach. ’Slid,
now I’m quite altered! blown into light colours;
let out oaths by th’ minute; sit up late till it be
early; drink drunk till I am sober; sink down
dead in a tavern, and rise in a tobacco-shop: here’s
a transformation! I was wont yet to pity the simple,
and leave ’em some money: ’slid, now I gull ’em
without conscience! I go without order, swear without
number, gull without mercy, and drink without
measure.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Maw.</span> I deny the last; for if you drink ne’er so
much, you drink within measure.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> How prove you that, sir?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Maw.</span> Because the drawers never fill their pots.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> Mass, that was well found out! all drunkards
may lawfully say, they drink within measure
by that trick. And, now I’m put i’ th’ mind of a
trick, can you keep your countenance, villains?
Yet I am a fool to ask that; for how can they keep
their countenance that have lost their credits?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Hob.</span> I warrant you for blushing, captain.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> I easily believe that, ancient, for thou lost
thy colours once. Nay, faith, as for blushing, I
think there’s grace little enough amongst you all;
’tis Lent in your cheeks, the flag’s down.<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c017'><sup>[725]</sup></a> Well,
your blushing face I suspect not, nor indeed greatly
your laughing face, unless you had more money in
your purses. Then thus compendiously now. You
all know the possibilities of my hereafter fortunes,
and the humour of my frolic grandsire, Sir Bounteous
Progress, whose death makes all possible to
me: I shall have all, when he has nothing; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>now he has all, I shall have nothing. I think one
mind runs through a million of ’em; they love to
keep us sober all the while they’re alive, that when
they’re dead we may drink to their healths; they
cannot abide to see us merry all the while they’re
above ground, and that makes so many laugh at
their fathers’ funerals. I know my grandsire has
his will in a box, and has bequeathed all to me,
when he can carry nothing away; but stood I in
need of poor ten pounds now, by his will I should
hang myself ere I should get it: there’s no such
word in his will, I warrant you, nor no such thought
in his mind.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Maw.</span> You may build upon that, captain.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> Then since he has no will to do me good
as long as he lives, by mine own will I’ll do myself
good before he dies; and now I arrive at the purpose.
You are not ignorant, I’m sure, you true
and necessary implements of mischief, first, that
my grandsire, Sir Bounteous Progress, is a knight
of thousands, and therefore no knight since one
thousand six hundred;<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c017'><sup>[726]</sup></a> next, that he keeps a house
like his name, bounteous, open for all comers;
thirdly and lastly, that he stands much upon <a id='e2.333.25'></a><a href='#errata2.333.25'>the glory of his complement</a>,<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c017'><sup>[727]</sup></a> variety of entertainment,
together with the largeness of his kitchen, longitude
of his buttery, and fecundity of his larder;
and thinks himself never happier than when some
stiff lord or great countess alights to make light
his dishes. These being well mixed together, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>give my project better encouragement, and make
my purpose spring forth more fortunate: to be
short, and cut off a great deal of dirty way, I’ll
down to my grandsire like a lord.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Maw.</span> How, captain?</p>

<p class='c020 prose'><span class='sc'>Fol.</span> A French ruff, a thin beard, and a strong
perfume will do’t. I can hire blue coats<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c017'><sup>[728]</sup></a> for you
all by Westminster clock, and that colour will be
soonest believed.</p>

still my wife, sweet mistress Harebrain? When
she sent for me, a’ one side of her bed stood the
physician, the scrivener on the other; two horrible
objects, but mere opposites in the course of their

makes them loose.</p>

best and richest jewel given as a legacy unto my

the woodcut, a fac-simile of which is now given, representing

<p class='c055'>This drama has been reprinted in the sixth vol. of the last

<p class='c055'><i>Roaring Boys</i> was a cant term for the riotous, quarrelsome

more correctly it should seem, has fixed her birth in 1584.
“From the first entrance into a competency of age,” she
assumed the doublet, “and to her dying day she would
not leave it off, till the infirmity and weaknesse of nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>had brought her a-bed to her last travail, changed it for a
wastcoat, and her pettycoats for a winding-sheet,” <cite>Life</cite>, p. 18.
She was distinguished in the different characters of bully,
prostitute, procuress, fortune-teller, thief, pickpocket, receiver
of stolen goods, and forger of writings. A letter from John
Chamberlain to Mr. Carleton, dated Feb. 11, 1611-12, gives
the following account of her doing penance: “The last Sunday
Moll Cutpurse, a notorious baggage that used to go in
man’s apparel, and challenged the field of diverse gallants;
was brought to the same place [Paul’s Cross], where she wept
bitterly, and seemed very penitent; but it is since doubted
she was maudlin drunk, being discovered to have tippel’d of
three quarts of sack before she came to her penance. She
had the daintiest preacher or ghostly father that ever I saw
in the pulpit, one Radcliffe of Brazen-Nose College in Oxford,
a likelier man to have led the revels in some inn of court,
than to be where he was. But the best is, he did extreme
badly, and so wearied the audience, that the best part went
away, and the rest tarried rather to hear Moll Cutpurse than
him.”<a id='r940'></a><a href='#f940' class='c017'><sup>[940]</sup></a> With the preceding extract let us compare what the
“fair penitent” is made to say in the <cite>Life</cite> already quoted:
“Some promooting Apparitor, set on by an adversary of mine,
whom I could never punctually know, cited me to appear in
the Court of the Arches, where was an Accusation exhibited
against me for wearing undecent and manly apparel. I was
advised by my Proctor to demur to the Jurisdiction of the
Court, as for a Crime, if such, not cognizable there or elsewhere;
but he did it to spin out my Cause, and get my
Mony; for in the conclusion, I was sentenced there to stand
and do Penance in a White Sheet at Paul’s Cross, during
morning Sermon on a Sunday,” p. 69.</p>

<p class='c041'>We are told that she robbed General Fairfax of 250 Jacobuses
upon Hounslow Heath, shot him through the arm,
and killed two horses on which a couple of his servants rode;
and that being closely pursued by some Parliamentarian officers
quartered at Hounslow, to whom Fairfax told the adventure,
and her horse failing her at Turnham Green, she was
apprehended and carried to Newgate, after which she was
condemned, but procured her pardon by giving her adversary
2000 pounds!<a id='r941'></a><a href='#f941' class='c017'><sup>[941]</sup></a> The story seems to be not a little

<p class='c041'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>Nor is the reader bound to believe the subjoined anecdote;
but, as Moll had a house of her own “within 2 doors of the
Globe Tavern in Fleet Street, over against the Conduit,” <cite>Life</cite>,
p. 47, and appears to have acquired considerable property by
her various rogueries, the circumstance of her supplying the
wine is by no means improbable: “After that unnatural and
detestable Rebellion of the Scots in 1638, upon his Majesties
return home to London, where preparation was made for his
Magnificent Entry, I was also resolved to show my Loyal and
Dutiful Respects to the King in as ample manner as I could or
might be permitted.... I was resolved in my own account
to beare a part in the charge of this Solemnity; and therefore
undertook to supply Fleetstreet Conduit adjacent to my House
with Wine, to run continually for that triumphal Day, which
I performed with no less Expence then Credit and delight,
and the satisfaction of all Comers and Spectators. And as
the King passed by me, I put out my Hand and caught Him
by His, and grasped it very hard, saying, <em>Welcome Home</em>
<span class='sc'>Charles</span>! His Majesty smiled, and I beleeve took me for
some Mad Bold Beatrice or other, while the people shouted
and made a noyse, in part at my Confidence and presumption,
and in part for joy of the King’s Return. The rest of that
Day I spent in jollity and carousing, and concluded the night
with Fireworks and Drink. This celebrated Action of mine,
it being the Town talk, made people look upon me at another
rate then formerly.” <cite>Life</cite>, pp. 95-98.</p>

<p class='c041'>A dropsy, from which she had long been suffering, and
which, it is said, would probably have carried her off sooner
if she had not indulged greatly in the use of tobacco—(for
she gloried in being the first female smoker)—at last proved
fatal to the Roaring Girl. In the Memoir above cited, she
is represented as bidding adieu to the world “this three
score and fourteenth year of my age,” p. 169. A MS.<a id='r942'></a><a href='#f942' class='c017'><sup>[942]</sup></a> states
that she died at her house in Fleet Street, July 26, 1659; that
she was buried in the church of Saint Bridget’s; and that she
left twenty pounds by will, that the Conduit might run with
wine when King Charles the Second should return. Granger
says,<a id='r943'></a><a href='#f943' class='c017'><sup>[943]</sup></a> that her death took place in her 75th year.</p>

<p class='c041'>From <cite>The Witch of Edmonton</cite> (by W. Rowley, Dekker, and

<p class='c041'>Thomas Dekker, whose name is coupled with Middleton’s

many of his plays have perished.</p>

</div>

<p class='c043'>The fashion of play-making I can properly compare
to nothing so naturally as the alteration in
apparel; for in the time of the great crop-doublet,
your huge bombasted plays, quilted with mighty
words to lean purpose, were<a id='r947'></a><a href='#f947' class='c017'><sup>[947]</sup></a> only then in fashion:
and as the doublet fell, neater inventions began to
set up. Now, in the time of spruceness, our plays
follow the niceness of our garments; single plots,
quaint conceits, lecherous jests, drest up in hanging
sleeves: and those are fit for the times and the
termers.<a id='r948'></a><a href='#f948' class='c017'><sup>[948]</sup></a> Such a kind of light-colour summer stuff,
mingled with divers colours, you shall find this
published comedy; good to keep you in an afternoon
from dice at home in your chambers: and for
venery, you shall find enough for sixpence,<a id='r949'></a><a href='#f949' class='c017'><sup>[949]</sup></a> but
well couched and<a id='r950'></a><a href='#f950' class='c017'><sup>[950]</sup></a> you mark it; for Venus, being
a woman, passes through the play in doublet and
breeches; a brave disguise and a safe one, if the
statute untie not her codpiece point. The book I
make no question but is fit for many of your companies,
as well as the person itself, and may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>allowed both gallery-room at the playhouse, and
chamber-room at your lodging. Worse things, I
must needs confess, the world has taxed her for
than has been written of her; but ’tis the excellency
of a writer to leave things better than he
finds ’em; though some obscene fellow, that cares
not what he writes against others, yet keeps a mystical
bawdyhouse himself, and entertains drunkards,
to make use of their pockets and vent his private
bottle-ale at midnight,—though such a one would
have ript up the most nasty vice that ever hell
belched forth, and presented it to a modest assembly,
yet we rather wish in such discoveries, where reputation
lies bleeding, a slackness of truth than
fulness of slander.</p>

eds. the entrance of these “right worshipful seniors” is not
marked, and the prefixes to their speeches are merely 1., 2.,

be no doubt. That the other two are Limber and Kix, is,
I think, as certain: they appear together with Onesiphorus
in the last scene of the play, where they are addressed as
“<em>old</em> master Limber and master Kix,” and where they immediately
recognise the Courtesan.—The editor of 1816 makes
the stage-direction here “<i>Enter Two Gentlemen</i>:” he ought
at least to have observed, that the speech which concludes
this scene is given to a <em>third</em> speaker.</p>

“<i>Enter at Cole-harbour, Hoord, the Widdow, and Gentlemen,
he married now.</i>”—<em>Cole-Harbour</em> (a corruption of <em>Cold-Harbour</em>,
or <em>Cold-Harborough</em>) was an ancient building, situated
in the parish of All-hallows the Less, in Downgate Ward:
see an account of it in Stow’s <cite>Survey</cite>, b. ii. p. 206. (vol. i.)
ed. 1720. A good many years before the date of this
play, the then Earl of Shrewsbury took it down, and built a
number of small tenements in its stead, which were let at
great rents, and served as a retreat for debtors, &#38;c.; the
place being considered a sort of sanctuary, probably because
Tunstall, bishop of Durham, had resided there in Henry
the Eighth’s reign. Lodge says, “It was pulled down by
Earl Gilbert, about the year 1600.” <cite>Illust. of Brit. Hist.</cite>
vol. i. p. 9: but its demolition must have been earlier; for,
in Nash’s <cite>Haue with you to Saffron Walden</cite>, 1596, we find, “Or
hast thou tooke thee a chamber in <em>Cole-harbour</em>?” &#38;c. sig. <span class='fss'>D.</span> 4.
From the present scene, as the editor of 1816 observes in
a note on act ii. sc. 1, “it may be inferred that it was notorious
as a place where marriages were solemnised hastily
and without the proper forms; such as the Fleet Prison and
Keith’s Chapel were for some time previously to the passing
the marriage-act.” He adds, that “the only [other] allusion
he recollects to it among the dramatic writers of the
time, is in our author’s <cite>Roaring Girl</cite>:” but half-a-dozen
might easily be furnished.</p>

<p class='c020 prose'>I have already noticed (p. <a href='#f268'>142</a>) the want of moveable painted
scenery in Middleton’s days. Here the spectators were to suppose
that Gerardine and Maria, standing on the upper-stage
(see <a href='#f218'>note</a>, p. 125), were either in the apartment of the latter,
or in the gallery communicating with it (see p. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>): when
Lipsalve had entered, they were to suppose that the stage
represented a street; and when Gerardine and Maria had
re-appeared “<em>above</em>,” they were to suppose that the upper-stage
was a window. Having found it necessary to begin a
new scene with the entrance of Lipsalve, I hope my readers
will be kind enough to <em>suppose</em> that, when Gerardine says
“<em>who comes here</em>,” he happens to turn his eye towards the
window, and catches a glimpse of that gallant.</p>

of Anjou resided in England. That prince, brother to Charles
the Ninth, king of France, on the encouragement he had received
from Queen Elizabeth, visited the English court in
the year 1581, and expected to have been united to her majesty
in marriage. The queen, however, after many affected
delays, broke off the treaty; and the duke was obliged to return
to his own country, with the disgrace of a direct refusal.

I do not agree with the editor [Reed], that the same person
is meant by the German ‘who escaped out of Woodstreet.’
The <em>high German</em> must have been some man generally known
for strength or size; that the same person should also have
had a very narrow escape from Wood Street, is possible to be
sure, but very improbable. Perhaps the <em>high German</em> was the
famous fencer, whose feats are thus recorded: ‘Since the

lost their lives there, obtained the name of <em>Perilous Pool</em>. To
prevent these accidents, it was in a manner filled up until the

<p class='c001'>The footnote scheme used lettered references, repeating a-z. On numerous
of occasions, letters were repeated, and sometimes skipped. The numeric
resequencing of notes here resolves those lapses. Footnotes are sometimes
referred to directly in a footnote by its letter designation. The few
direct references to a lettered note use the new numeric value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Footnotes frequently refer to other notes, usually only by referring the
the page where they can be found. Sometimes those cross-references are not
accurate and the correct location cannot be ascertained.</p>
